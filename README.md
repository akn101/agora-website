# Agora - Refugee Support Platform

A secure, community-driven mobile platform designed to help refugees overcome social isolation by connecting with others who share their cultural, linguistic, and regional backgrounds.

## About Agora

Agora empowers refugees to take control of their social integration journey by forming or joining localised digital communities, hosting and attending events, and engaging in conversation in their own language, within groups tailored to their identity and experience.

Built in collaboration with refugee support organisations and global experts, Agora is designed to be simple, safe, and scalable — giving refugees the tools they need to create their own meaningful support networks.
